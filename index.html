        <h1>The Creative Process</h1>
        <p>Creativity is more than just splattering paint on a blank canvas. 
            It's taking a different route home from work. It's eating a meal with your nondominant hand. 
            It's turning a fimiliar painting upside down. It's watching a movie you've seen 20 times over with the sound off. 
            It's parting your hair on the other side. 
            For me being creative starts with breaking down pardigms.
            It's all about changing the way you currently see the world. 
            The next tiem you see something that strikes you as creative, think about how someone must've seen the world differntly to create that.
            </p>

        <h2>Reviewing Music</h2>
        <p>Reviewing music is an opportunity for music lovers to take a deeper dive into the content they love.
            It invites thought and examination and many times even cross reference.
            Like any piece of art or literature, music was meant to be explorer and critiqued.</p>
